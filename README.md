# Coursera Video Page Floating Fix

Recently I encountered a issue on Coursera page, while watching the videos, page starts floating Horizontally, which was quite irritating. After ispecting it from chrome developers tool, I figured out some issue of some CSS Stying.

Thus, I've created a small extension for chrome browser, which overrides the css of particular class , whenever any of video page of coursera is opened in the browser.
